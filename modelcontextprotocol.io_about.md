Model Context Protocol

[Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) [Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18) [Community](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication) [About MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/about)

## Connect your AI applications to the world

AI-enabled tools are powerful, but they’re often limited to the
information you manually provide or require bespoke integrations.

Whether it’s reading files from your computer, searching through an
internal or external knowledge base, or updating tasks in an project
management tool, MCP provides a secure, standardized, _simple_ way
to give AI systems the context they need.

## How it works

### 1 Choose MCP servers

Pick from pre-built servers for popular tools like GitHub, Google
Drive, Slack and hundreds of others. Combine multiple servers for
complete workflows, or easily build your own for custom
integrations.

### 2 Connect your AI application

Configure your AI application (like Claude, VS Code, or ChatGPT)
to connect to your MCP servers. The application can now see
available tools, resources and prompts from all connected servers.

### 3 Work with context

Your AI-powered application can now access real data, execute
actions, and provide more helpful responses based on your actual
context.
